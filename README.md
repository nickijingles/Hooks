For those of you who are visiting from JuliaCon2021 after viewing the Sonification Experience video, due to personal circumstances, I have not had chance to upload the information I wanted to. My sincere apologies. 
I intend to do so this weekend, so please check back in a few days. In the meantime, please feel free to email me any questions at nca59@uclive.ac.nz.

Sonification is a really exciting field and I'm looking forward to sharing my forthcoming work, both from a technical data science persepctive and also a musical/sound design one.
